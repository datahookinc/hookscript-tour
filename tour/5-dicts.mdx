		# DICTS

		In HookScript, `dicts` are a dynamic container type that allow you to store multiple values as key-value pairs. To create a dict,
		you place your comma separated key-value pairs between curly brackets `{ key: value, key: value, key: value }`:

		```
		var x dict = { name: "pj", age: 7}
		print(len(x)) // returns 2
		```

		When your key contains spaces, you place the key in quotes:

		```
		var x = { "is a cool cat": true }
		x["is a cool cat"] // returns true
		```

		## Retrieving Values by key
		To retrieve a value from a dict, use square brackets with the key name (e.g., `x["name"]`). A `null` value is returned if the key
		is not in the dictionary.

		```
		x["name"] // returns "pj"
		```
		
		## Assigning Values by key
		To assign a value to a dict, use square brackets with the key name in quotes (e.g., `x["name"]`). If the key does not already exist in the dictionary
		it will be created.

		```
		x["name"] = "cleo"
		```

		## Check if dict contains a key
		To check if a dict contains a key, use the `in` operator which will return `true` or `false`.

		```
		var myDict = { name: "PJ", age: 7 }
		"name" in myDict // returns true
		```
	
		## Dict Types
		Dicts can hold any type, including other dicts. You can specify that certain keys must exist in the dictionary and that they must
		have a specific type.
		
		To assign a type to a dict, place the type between `<` and `>` characters:
		
		```
		var x dict<name> // the assigned dict must have a key called `name`, which accepts any value
		var x dict<name text> // the assigned dict must have a key called `name` and its type must be `text`
		var x dict<name text, age?> // the assigned dict has an optional key called `age`, which accepts any value
		var x dict<name text, age? int> // the assigned dict has an optional key called `age` and its type must be `int`
		```

		When your dict contains other dicts, you use multiple indexes to retrieve and assign values:

		```
		var x = { cat: { name: "pj" } }
		x["cat"]["name"] // "pj""
		```
