		# TYPES

		In HookScript, you can declare your own variables and assign values to the them.

		There are *primitive* types and *container* types

		## Primitive types
		- **`any`** - see below
		- **`int`** - is used for integers (whole numbers)
		- **`float`** - is used for floating point numbers (decimals)
		- **`text`** - is used for character strings (letters and words)
		- **`bool`** - is used for boolean values (true or false)
		- **`datetime`** - (WIP)
		
		## Container types
		- `list` - a list of values
		- `dict` - a dynamic collection of key-value pairs
		- `record` - a static collection of key-value pairs

		```
var i int = 0
var b bool = true
var t text = "Hello"
var f float = 1.0
var l list = [1, 2, 3]
var d dict = { name: "pj", age: 7}
var r record<name, age> = ["pj", 7]
var a any = 1
		```

		## `any` type

		The **`any`** type is a way to say your variable/container can hold any type. This allows the language to be more
		dynamic. Under the hood, HookScript will automatically assign the `any` type whenever the developer does not explicitly declare a type.

		```
		// these two statements are the same
		var x = 10
		var x any = 10

		// these two statements are the same
		var list = [1, 2, 3]
		var list<any> = [1, 2, 3]
		```

		## typecasting with `as` keyword

		The **`as`** keyword is used to cast from one type to another. This can be useful when assigning values to variables that have declared types.

		```
		var x float = (5 + 5) as float
		var x = [1, 2, 3] as list<float>
		```

		**Note:** an **`int`** type is automatically cast to a **`float`** type wherever a **`float`** is expected

		## Named types

		HookScript allows you to create your own types, called `named types` using the `type` keyword similar to how you would declare a variable. This allows
		you to encapsulate logic for us throughout your script. Named types can be used like any other type and comparisons are made by name and by the underlying
		type.

		```
		type cat = record<name text, age int>
		var pj cat = ["PJ", 7]
		print(pj["name"])
		```
