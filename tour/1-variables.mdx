		# DECLARING VARIABLES

		In HookScript, you declare variables using the **`var`** keyword:

		```
		var name = "hook"
		```

		Variables do not need to be assigned a value immediately. If a value is not assigned, the variable will have a value of **`NULL`** (more on `NULL` later)

		```
		var name
		print(name) // NULL
		```
		
		To assign a new value to an existing variable, use the assignment operator ( `=` )
		
		```
		var name = "hook"
		name = "script"
		```

		HookScript is a *gradually typed* language, which means you can specify types for variables to improve type checking and reduce runtime errors. For example, if I want a variable to only hold `int` types,
		I would specify the type after the variable name:

		```
		var x int = 10
		x = "a string" // will throw a type check error
		```

		You can use the gradually typed feature of the language to improve the developer experience by determining how explicit
		you want to be when writing your code. In the example below, the variable `x` can hold **`any`** type since a type was not provided when `x` was
		declared:

		```
		var x = 10 // x is int type
		x = "Hello World" // x is text type
		x = true // x is bool type
		x = 3.14 // x is float type
		```

		**Note:** use double forward slashes for comments ( `// your comment` )
