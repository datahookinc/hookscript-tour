		# MDE OPERATOR

		The **MDE OPERATOR** is a special operator that allows you to manually enter data into your script.

		To enter your data, you use the MDE Operator's **CONFIG** clause. Most operators require configuration, which is handled by the **CONFIG** clause.

		It is idiomatic to declare your **CONFIG** clause at the top of your operator.

		The **CONFIG** clause must return a **map** data type, with a property called *Data* that is also a **map** data type, where each property is a column of data. For an MDE, we can use this syntax as a template:

		```
		CONFIG {
	 		let c map = {
	 			Data map: {
	 				Name []text: ["PJ", "Cleo"],
	 				Age []int: [5, 8],
	 			}
	 		}
	 		return c
	 	}
		```

		In the next section, we will discuss **variables** and **types**, but for now you can change the data produced your MDE by adding more properties to the *Data* map, and adding more entries into each column.

		To add a new column:
		```
		CONFIG {
			let c map = {
				Data map: {
					Name []text: ["PJ", "Cleo"],
					Age []int: [5, 8],
					Species []text: ["cat", "chonker"],
				}
			}
			return c
	 	}
		```
		Note: don't forget to update your streams if you want the new column to be sent. In the above example, the stream would need to become:

		`INPUT MDE(): sA<Name text, Age int, Species text> { ... }`
	</div>
