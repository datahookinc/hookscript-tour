		# STREAMS

		In HookScript you use __`STREAMS`__ to pass data between your operators.

		There are 2 kinds of streams in HookScript:

		- __input streams__ move data into your operator
		- __output streams__ move data out of your operator

		Not all operators allow for input streams, but all operators have at least one output stream. By definition, __`INPUT`__ operators do not have input streams because they generate their own data.

		To work with streams, you use the following syntax:

		```
		INPUT MDE(): sA<Name text, Age int> { ... }

		OUTPUT DATASET(sA): out<Name text, Age int> { ... }
		```

		Input streams immediately follow the operator name and use parentheses __( )__ to list the input streams (similar to function calls in other programming languages)

		In the above example, the __`INPUT MDE`__ operator does not accept input streams, so we leave it empty: __`OPERATOR MDE()`__

		We then declare the operator's output stream(s) by using a colon __:__, naming the stream __sA__, and enclosing its column names and types in angle brackets __\<\>__

		If we were creating multiple output streams we can comma separate them (e.g., __sA\<Name text\>, sB\<Age int\>__). The streams can be named whatever you like, but there can be no whitespace in the name.

		In the above example, the __`OUPUT DATASET`__ operator uses the __sA__ stream created by the __`INPUT MDE`__ operator, so it declares __sA__ as an incoming stream. If it had multiple incoming streams, it would comma
		separate them (e.g., __(sA, sB)__)

		Finally, the __`OUTPUT DATASET`__ creates its own output stream __`out<Name text, Age int>`__
