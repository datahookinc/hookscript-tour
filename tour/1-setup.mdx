		# SETTING UP YOUR SCRIPT

		In HookScript, your script has two major sections: __`DEFINITIONS`__ and __`GRAPH`__.
		
		- __`DEFINITIONS`__ is found at the top of the script, and is used for definining *types* and *parameters* (more on parameters later)
		- __`GRAPH`__ is where your script does its work. It is called a graph because your data flows through a *Directed Acyclic Graph*

		Example script:
		```
		DEFINITIONS {}

		GRAPH {}
		```

		Running your script with an empty __`GRAPH`__ will cause an error because the script is expecting your __`GRAPH`__ to be populated with __`OPERATORS`__, which are introduced in the next lesson.
