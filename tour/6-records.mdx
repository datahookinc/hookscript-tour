		# RECORDS

		In HookScript, `records` are a static container type that allow you to store multiple values as field-value pairs. To create a record, you 
		first specify your record type and then assign its values using a `list` or `dict`. Unlike a `dict`, a `record` can only have values for the
		fields you specify.

		```
		var x record<name, age> = ["name", 7]
		print(len(x)) // returns 2

		var x record<name, age> = { name: "pj", age: 7}
		print(len(x)) // returns 2
		```

		When your field name contains spaces, you place the field name in quotes:

		```
		var x record<"is cool cat", age> = [true, 7]
		x["is a cool cat"] // returns true
		```

		## Retrieving values by field name
		To retrieve a value from a record, use square brackets with the field name in quotes (e.g., `x["name"]`). A `null` value is returned if the field
		is not in the record.

		```
		x["name"] // returns "pj"
		```
		
		## Assigning values by field name
		To assign a value to a record by field name, use square brackets with the field name in quotes (e.g., `x["name"]`). If the field does not exist on the record, an `invalid field`
		error will be thrown

		```
		x["name"] = "Cleo"
		```

		## Retrieving values by field index
		Records allow you to retrieve values based on their field index. Indexes are zero-based (e.g., `[0]` references the first field in your record) and can be
		negative (e.g., `[-1]` references the last field in your record)

		```
		var x record<name, age> = ["PJ", 7]
		x[0] // returns "PJ"
		x[-1] // returns 7
		```

		## Assigning values by field index
		Records allow you to assign values based on their field index. Indexes are zero-based (e.g., `[0]` references the first field in your record) and can be
		negative (e.g., `[-1]` references the last field in your record)

		```
		x[0] = "Cleo"
		```
	
		## Record types
		Records can hold any type, including other records. You must specify at least one field name.
		
		To assign fields to a record, place the field names between `<` and `>` characters with their types:
		
		```
		var x record<name> // the record has one field called `name` that is an `any` type
		var x record<name text> /// the record has one field called `name` that is a `text` type
		var x record<name text, age int> // the record has two fields called `name` and `age` of types `text` and `int` respectively
		var x dict<name, description text> // the record has two fields called `name` and `description` that are both `text` types
		```

		When your record contains other records, you use multiple indexes to retrieve and assign values:

		```
		var x record<cat record<name text>> = { cat: ["pj"]}
		x["cat"]["name"] // returns "pj"
		```
