		# CONDITIONALS

		In HookScript, the `if` statement is used to evaluate conditional logic (e.g., true/false)

		## if-elseif-else-end Statement
		Start your conditional with the **`if`** keyword, followed by your condition and a colon ( `:` ). The colon starts a new `block` with
		its own scope for declaring variables local to that block. All `if` statements are terminated with the **`end`** keyword, with additional
		logic expressed through **`elseif`** and **`else`** blocks as required.

		Examples:

		```
		if true:
			print("yes")
		else:
			print("no")
		end
		```

		```
		var x = 10
		if x > 10:
			print("x is greater than 10")
		elseif x > 8:
			print("x is greater than 8")
		elseif x > 6:
			print("x is greater than 6")
		else:
			print("x is less than or equal to 6")
		end
		```

		If statements can be expressed on a single line if desired:

		```
		if x > 10: return true end
		```

		## and/or
		You can create multiple conditions using the **`and`** and **`or`** keywords:
		
		```
		var x = 10
		if x > 10 and x < 20:
			print("x is between 10 and 20, exclusive")
		elseif x == 10 or x == 20:
			print("x is 10 or 20")
		end
		```
