		# RUN CLAUSE

		The **RUN** clauses are another way for you to control your operator. Similar to the **CONFIG** clause, you declare **RUN** clauses inside of your operator.

		There are two kinds of RUN clauses:
		- **ONRECORD** will run each time a record is received from a stream
		- **ONDONE** will run after all records have been received (this is the last chance to perform logic inside of your operator)

		You declare these clauses like this:

		```
		CONFIG { ... }
		RUN {
			ONRECORD { ... }
			ONDONE { ... }
		}
		```

		If your operator receives one or zero input streams, then you do not need to provide the stream name after declaring **ONRECORD**. However, if your operator does 
		receive more than one stream, then you must declare the stream name. For example, if my operator receives streams called **sA** and **sB** then I would declare the 
		previous statement as:

		```
		CONFIG { ... }
		RUN {
			ONRECORD sA { ... }
			ONRECORD sB { ... }
			ONDONE { ... }
		}
		```

		**RUN** clauses provide a powerful way for interacting with incoming data to perform data manipulations, such as:
		- calculations
		- filters
		- replacing values
		- sending your own records

		HookScript uses the dollar symbol ( **$** ) to refer to the current record inside of an **ONRECORD** clause. For instance to change a record value, we reference the record's column name and assign a new value:

		```
		RUN {
			ONRECORD sa {
				$["Name"] = "Replacing the incoming name"
			}
		}
		```
		
		In the editor example, we filter out all records where the age is less than 8. We also change the value for name.
